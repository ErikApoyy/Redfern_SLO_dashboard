# Redfern_SLO_dashboard

## 📊 Overview
This project is completed using Splunk Dashboard Studio. I created the comprehensive dashboard for Redfern LTD (Fictional company name) Service Level Objective. 


## 🧪 Sample SLO Metrics Tracked
| Metric                  | Description                               |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `SLO Trend (%)`         | Percentage of successful requests         |
| `Overall SLO trend (ms)`| Overall success rate                      |
| `P95 Request Time`      | 95th percentile request latency           |
| `Throughput by Category`| Number of request per category            |
| `Error Budget (%)`      | Percentage of used budget                 |

**Additional Detail For the Metric**
- The P95 request time is counted in millisecond. The figure indicates most of the request completed in under 1-second (1000ms).
- Error budget is negative, indicating the company is out of budget by the figure (21%).
